- The environment that we spend our time in would affect what we do there. Look around and see what type of activity the environment you live / work at is most suitable for?

- I like go for all server side code, and svelte for front end.

- Seems like Lawyers figured out **nobody reads the license agreements**. Just check [AWS service-terms](https://aws.amazon.com/service-terms/) item 42.10

  `**42.10.** Acceptable Use; Safety-Critical Systems. Your use of the Lumberyard Materials must comply with the AWS Acceptable Use Policy. The Lumberyard Materials are not intended for use with life-critical or safety-critical systems, such as use in operation of medical equipment, automated transportation systems, autonomous vehicles, aircraft or air traffic control, nuclear facilities, manned spacecraft, or military use in connection with live combat. However, this restriction will not apply in the event of the occurrence (certified by the United States Centers for Disease Control or successor body) of a widespread viral infection transmitted via bites or contact with bodily fluids that causes human corpses to reanimate and seek to consume living human flesh, blood, brain or nerve tissue and is likely to result in the fall of organized civilization.`

- What is a minimum yet meaningful project to use graphql in? 

### Nov 12, 2021

#### Thoughts

- I had one quick pass on graphql, it's an interesting technology. Perhaps a bit simpler than protobuf or similar techs. 
- I also learned about the life of K.H. and how his humble start and his thirst for progress combined with working hard made him so much successful. That was really educational.

#### Thoughts

- Is smart contracts good as a data store + payment service? Anything else seems to be too expensive to be done on block chains.



### Nov 15, 2021

#### Thoughts

- Testing smart contracts are very critical. If a contract has a bug / security flaw, the code will stay on the blockchain "forever".

#### Thoughts

- The need to reach the perfection quickly betrays the outcome. Perfection, as seen by others, is nothing but a snapshot from a never ending improvement process taken at a later stage. 

- Failures are honest feedbacks, if they are acted upon in the process.

#### Thoughts

- When issues keep happening and organizations don't learn the lesson, people do! That's why you see people in some organizations that don't care about anything but their pay check. Not that they were like this from the beginning. But they *learned* their lesson when tried to be proactive, warn others, and point to the issues and got the opposite result. 



### Nov 18, 2021

- Staying the course and getting to the finish line. 
- smart contracts will  enhance in the digital world.

- There are beliefs that prevent us from seeing the truths. The first step to freedom is to become aware of them.
