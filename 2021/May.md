- I just read an article on [CTV News](https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/we-whipped-up-an-app-in-about-three-hours-engineer-creates-tool-that-finds-nearby-vaccine-clinics-in-ontario-1.5410366) about a service app developed by two engineers that finds nearby vaccine clinics in Ontario. See [Zain Manji Tweet here](https://twitter.com/ZainManji/status/1388507856907821056?s=09). I can see the process as following:
	- I'm looking for vaccination sites for my postal code here in Ontario.
	- I'm not the only one who needs this.
	- What is the most common communication tool that is available to majority of Ontarians? It's SMS.
	- I can build a site that receives the Postal code, validate it, Look it up in the cache and responds back.
	- I also need to frequently hydrate the cache with the data that I gather from official websites.
- Now, the 2-engineer-team who did this has good knowledge and experience with SMS messaging and that was the super-enabler for them to deliver this service in hours.

#####   What I'm doing:

#####   What I'm doing:

- The example code for Vagrant is done and I've tested it on WIndows, Mac and Linux. It's amazing how un-natural development on Windows machines feels to me.
- Before trying on AWS and adding more complexity, I need to test vagrant on local machine.

- May the 4th be with you! 

#####   What I'm doing:
- The vagrant POC is done and can be found [here](https://github.com/abtin/govagrant)

#####   Today I learned:  
- It is so strange that the Vagrant team resisted adding a '-f' flag to the vagrant command so users could select a Vagrantfile. Instead they insist using environment variable. User experience matters my friends!

#####   Thoughts, Ideas, Opinions:
- I'm wondering how many go routines are the optimum to send pubsub messages to 1000 Cloud Run functions.
- I may also work on generating random Lat and Long for a selected radius.

#####   What I'm doing:
- The vagrant POC was delivered successfully.

#####   Thoughts, Ideas, Opinions:
- The way that Data Scientists work, at least the ones that I worked with, is closer to hacking than programming. Lots of band-aid, spits and gums keeping the pieces together. Python, as a great scripting language lacks when you want to have industial quality codes in production. 
- Perhaps there is some opportunities there.

#####   What I'm doing:
- dealing with time-series that are generated by hundreds of cloud functions and the data points comes out of orders. Sigh!
