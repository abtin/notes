- I just read an article on [CTV News](https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/we-whipped-up-an-app-in-about-three-hours-engineer-creates-tool-that-finds-nearby-vaccine-clinics-in-ontario-1.5410366) about a service app developed by two engineers that finds nearby vaccine clinics in Ontario. See [Zain Manji Tweet here](https://twitter.com/ZainManji/status/1388507856907821056?s=09). I can see the process as following:
	- I'm looking for vaccination sites for my postal code here in Ontario.
	- I'm not the only one who needs this.
	- What is the most common communication tool that is available to majority of Ontarians? It's SMS.
	- I can build a site that receives the Postal code, validate it, Look it up in the cache and responds back.
	- I also need to frequently hydrate the cache with the data that I gather from official websites.
- Now, the 2-engineer-team who did this has good knowledge and experience with SMS messaging and that was the super-enabler for them to deliver this service in hours.

#####   What I'm doing:

#####   What I'm doing:

- The example code for Vagrant is done and I've tested it on WIndows, Mac and Linux. It's amazing how un-natural development on Windows machines feels to me.
- Before trying on AWS and adding more complexity, I need to test vagrant on local machine.

#####   What I'm doing:
- The vagrant POC is done and can be found [here](https://github.com/abtin/govagrant)

#####   Today I learned:  
- It is so strange that the Vagrant team resisted adding a '-f' flag to the vagrant command so users could select a Vagrantfile. Instead they insist using environment variable. User experience matters my friends!

- I'm wondering how many go routines are the optimum to send pubsub messages to 1000 Cloud Run functions.
- I may also work on generating random Lat and Long for a selected radius.

#####   What I'm doing:
- The vagrant POC was delivered successfully.

#####   Thoughts, Ideas, Opinions:
- The way that Data Scientists work, at least the ones that I worked with, is closer to hacking than programming. Lots of band-aid, spits and gums keeping the pieces together. Python, as a great scripting language lacks when you want to have industial quality codes in production. 
- Perhaps there is some opportunities there.

#####   What I'm doing:
- dealing with time-series that are generated by hundreds of cloud functions and the data points comes out of orders. Sigh!

#####   Today I learned: 
- Elimination Cascades strategy in problem solving by ruling out possibilities.

#####   Thoughts, Ideas, Opinions:
- I used to like python, but it's a seriously limitted language. The pain of productionalization of ML models running on cloud to handle 60 conversation per seconds thought me that no serious work should be done in python. It's a good scripting language, great for quickly hacking some ideas. It's unfortunate that a lot of ML libraries are available in Python. 
- I would be looking at Rust as I've heard it is used in ML work in conjunctions with python. I wished if Go had all the ML libraries, though. The code would me way more readable.
- Hybrid-cloud with fast or near real-time performance/through put requirements is a joke. Either do it on-prem or do it on cloud.
- There is a price to anything. Price of software development for cloud is not cheap and more people would learn this.

#####   What I'm doing:
- I had to re-write my cloud solution in 3 ways and do some fine tuning to get the result I needed. I may liberate some demo code out.

#####   Thoughts, Ideas, Opinions:
- I got interested to use new problem solving strategies I learned in doing my work.
- I need to re-think a lot of ideas and my opinions. Same way of thinking will result in same way of doing. And repeating the same thing and expecting a different result is definition of insanity!

#####   What I'm doing:
- some bug fixes due to unexpected behavior of CloudRun.

#####   Thoughts, Ideas, Opinions:
- In my experience one of the biggest contributing factors to lower software quality is the rush to get it out.  If programmers have more time to think and review their design and their code, then we'll see higher quality results.

#####   What I'm doing:
