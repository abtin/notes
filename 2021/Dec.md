- Ikigai is something everyone has, even if they are not aware of it. 
- When you find your Ikigai, you'll be calm and blissful.
- Is it possible to find it this month?

- Ikigai is as much about giving as about getting. Finding the right balance that creates happiness. You wake up in the morning, because you know you want to provide, to give. And you know there is a demand for it, and you'll be appreciated.

- I'm delaying working on my new idea to later time. This allows me to do a better research and also consider if I really want to work on it.
