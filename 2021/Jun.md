##### 	Thoughts, Ideas, Opinions:

- I've been dealing with some complexities in the smart contract I'm developing and realized I'll have to use the old trick to tackle it. Basically break the problem into small pieces and make sense of them separately then combine them in a more complex contract.

##### 	What I'm doing:
- I've been using brownie and it looks good.

##### 	Thoughts, Ideas, Opinions:
- Programming smart contracts is a different paradigm. I'm still wrapping my head around the ways to do simplest things like checking if a string is empty!

##### 	What I'm doing:
- still playing with solidity and brownie but making small progress.

### June 4, 2021

##### 	Thoughts, Ideas, Opinions:
- I found some limitations with solidity which forced me to redo the logic in a different way. I feel blockchain is still in early stages and is not ready for mainstream, hence all versions are 0.x.y.
##### 	What I'm doing:
- early cut of the contract is ready. but I need to test it.

##### 	Thoughts, Ideas, Opinions:
- Although solving my smart contract problem has been helping me to learn more about solidity, I'm in a state that I think I need to review the solution before getting deeper and see if there is a simpler way.
- Also I talked to a friend about Competitive Programming. I see CP as a game, similar to speed chess. I believe that  CP has small value in real life and it actually promote some bad skills. The worse part is that FAANG are the supported of the CP. I personally don't know a single great computer scientist that I follow or had the opportunity to be mentored by that approve CP as a way to build useful skills.

- If a caveman time travels to today and see the silhouette of the city what would they think of it? Probably, a weird shaped mountains. What would be our reaction if we travel to future far enough that Quantum Computers are abundant and everywhere? What do we see them as? City lights? Decorations?
