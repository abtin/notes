- I'm inspired by these two quotes:

  > â€œtry to leave this world a little better than you found it" - Sir Robert Baden-Powell

  > "Science is far from a perfect instrument of knowledge. It's just the best we have. In this respect, as in many others, it's like democracy." - Carl Sagan

- How do you start thinking about a new software you're going to build. Start with the data? Like OO and DDD? Are they still relevant?

- Technical debt is a very contextual subject. 
  - If you're a startup using a new technology, you may accrue technical debt which requires refactoring on a later stage of your company, or never if the projects goes belly up.
  - If you're a startup using a know technology to your team, you may accrue technical debt of repeating the known patterns but missing the opportunities of using something new. You may have a chance to refactor later, or basically building a legacy system right off the bat. 
  - If you are a ...
- There are so many possibilities. Someone said, technical debt is good, it shows you delivered something, or did something pragmatic. It's like borrowing money to start a business.

- The only path of learning that seems to still be open to me is learning by doing! And perhaps blog or tiktok about it, as a reminder to my future self.
- It's amazing what a huge gap there is in my mind between what I call Senior Software Engineer and many people on social media who carry the title.

- Today I heard an interesting "fact" that as humans we live for around 4000 weeks. This is not too long. Why work should take most of our lives?

- It's amazing that when I talk to some smart people in large organizations who want to do a lot of good and right things but they don't seems to understand that their current state is a reflection of their organization. People, Processes, Culture, Reporting structure, Career path and a lot of other non technical aspects are usually the culprit than a big corp cannot become as nimble and innovative as some smaller, yet right size, firms. To solve your problem don't look outside, look inside!

- I had a horrible experience with Azure DevOps. In 2021, the quality of this service should have been considered as a joke! Seems like story is repeating itself again. 30 years ago IBM was so comfortable with all their clients. Microsoft was so small, but they grew and stole the enterprise from IBM. I'm wondering who is going to steal enterprises from Microsoft. A new generation of technology can be the catalyst.

- A while ago i was thinking about the paper I read back in university about Discrete Event Simulation and I googled it up. I ended up with a link to SimPy. Today I had a conversation about some problem that was attempted to be solved using SimPy. The estimation was 31,000 years to solve the full model. It needs some investigations.

- Past few days has been very busy but I got a chance to play with github copilot. Although I like the name very much, it's more of a trainee pilot than a copilot. I appreciate the work though. It was even helping me in writing the readme file, which impressed me a lot more than what they did for the coding part! Seems like finally AI is coming to rescue programmers from writing the readme files.

- I think this new trend of low-code and no-code will create a big opportunity in a few years  for real software engineers to throw away the hello-world level apps that are built using them and develop and deliver industrial strength version of them that are scalable, expendable and maintainable.
