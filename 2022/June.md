- Happy June!  ❤
- I think a properly designed workspace is superior to work-from-home setups. Collaborative work is something that is missing from all these remote work.
- idea: AI based English to ASL.

#### Thoughts

- I'm an idiot, but I'm not the only one! This is such a strong statement. Everyone is an idiot in some things.
- The freedom that comes from taking a step past being vulnerable is enormous.
- Stop echoing whatever you hear. Input-processing-output. No output is also a valid result of processing.

#### Thoughts

- Very busy day! 



### June 15, 2022

#### Thoughts

- Next challenge: Widening the buffer between emotion and decision. Bringing the blood from limbic system to the frontal lobe. 
- Question: If the outcome of a life decision - that we consider as biggest mistake - is great, can that decision still be considered as a mistake?

- So many times it happens too fast
  You change your passion for glory

### June 23, 2022

#### Thoughts

- Ask and you shall be given.
- Use best reasoning and convincing technics.



### June 24, 2022

#### Thoughts

- Played a bit with terratest and Azure. The library is interesting since it allows integration testing done as part of CICD with actual creation of resources on cloud. It looks like a bit light on Azure comparing to AWS though and there is no gcp support. 



### June 25, 2022

#### Thoughts

- Used the gap between feeling and decision. Barely noticed it. But I can identify it.
