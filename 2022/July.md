- Getting good rest is a medicine on itself. We still don't know much about our body. It's not far from miracle they way it works, whether it was evolved or designed.

#### Thoughts

- Why are we calling it technical debt if we are not going to pay it back? What is the culture of go fast or you'd miss it? Why can't we do the right thing instead of the easy thing?

#### Thoughts

- going to build a folder of all smaller micro apps, codes that have single focus and can be combined together for future projects. It's like investigating how to build ikea parts for later assembly.

- Today I had a first hand experience about talkers vs doers. How talkers who cannot build anything are given the power to dictate the direction of the way things should be done. I have no problem with people looking at the bigger picture, but I disagree with giving power to talkers. Medical system got it right. The head of a hospital department has to be a doctor.

- Trying to make sense of WORM capability of MinIO. It doesn't makes sense to me that I'm not only allowed to delete the object versions but I can delete the object itself.

- Ok. MinIO makes sense. Deleting just creates a new version. Also with access and policy gives proper fine grained control.

#### Thoughts

- ArgoCD is cool and all, but there still are other deployment targets than Kubernetes. Just saying.



### July 12, 2022

- I need to play with Microsoft ASE a little. Try to deploy it with terraform and deploy an app/function into it.



### July 13, 2022

- A comparison between AKS and GKE is on the way. Also need to compare ASE scaling with K8S (AKS) scaling.
