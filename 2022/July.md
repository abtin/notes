- Getting good rest is a medicine on itself. We still don't know much about our body. It's not far from miracle they way it works, whether it was evolved or designed.

- Why are we calling it technical debt if we are not going to pay it back? What is the culture of go fast or you'd miss it? Why can't we do the right thing instead of the easy thing?

- going to build a folder of all smaller micro apps, codes that have single focus and can be combined together for future projects. It's like investigating how to build ikea parts for later assembly.

- Today I had a first hand experience about talkers vs doers. How talkers who cannot build anything are given the power to dictate the direction of the way things should be done. I have no problem with people looking at the bigger picture, but I disagree with giving power to talkers. Medical system got it right. The head of a hospital department has to be a doctor.
