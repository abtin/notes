#### Thoughts

- Getting good rest is a medicine on itself. We still don't know much about our body. It's not far from miracle they way it works, whether it was evolved or designed.



### July 03, 2022

#### Thoughts

- Why are we calling it technical debt if we are not going to pay it back? What is the culture of go fast or you'd miss it? Why can't we do the right thing instead of the easy thing?

#### Thoughts

- going to build a folder of all smaller micro apps, codes that have single focus and can be combined together for future projects. It's like investigating how to build ikea parts for later assembly.

- Today I had a first hand experience about talkers vs doers. How talkers who cannot build anything are given the power to dictate the direction of the way things should be done. I have no problem with people looking at the bigger picture, but I disagree with giving power to talkers. Medical system got it right. The head of a hospital department has to be a doctor.

- Trying to make sense of WORM capability of MinIO. It doesn't makes sense to me that I'm not only allowed to delete the object versions but I can delete the object itself.



### July 07, 2022

- Ok. MinIO makes sense. Deleting just creates a new version. Also with access and policy gives proper fine grained control.

#### Thoughts

- Can Microsoft Power Apps deliver real applications? The target audience is people with Word and Excel knowledge. Basically BAs.

- Us us us us and Them them them them....

- Digging into the dark magic of CSS.



### July 11, 2022

#### Thoughts

- ArgoCD is cool and all, but there still are other deployment targets than Kubernetes. Just saying.



### July 12, 2022

- I need to play with Microsoft ASE a little. Try to deploy it with terraform and deploy an app/function into it.



### July 13, 2022

- A comparison between AKS and GKE is on the way. Also need to compare ASE scaling with K8S (AKS) scaling.



### July 14, 2022

- A wild day! 



### July 15, 2022

- Playing with helm.



### July 16, 2022

- Please don't force OOP on Go. It was a torture listening to Go.FM hearing about it. It's a rabbit hole that ends up in spring boot!!

 

### July 17, 2022

- Never knew helm has such an extended set of functions. 



### July 18, 2022

- Test is running in k8s. Next: do some load testing. Looking at you `hey`!



### July 19, 2022

- Time to deploy the test as functions App in ASE. So far Azure doesn't work intuitively. Azure feels it was built by enterprise for enterprise. Will need more work.



### July 20, 2022

- Azure python functions impl is utterly weird. I'm wondering why instead of using Flask, they invented their own http server.



### July 21, 2022

- I thought gcp docs were bad. Azure took it to the next level. 



### July 22, 2022

- Like to play with pulumi a bit. See if I can use it to setup ASE.



### July 23, 2022

- There is very little left. Almost nothing to hold it together. Don't know how it's going to be.



### July 24, 2022

- Very productive day. good workout and good progress with the etl code on Azure Func.



### July 25, 2022

- Talkers vs. doers. Doers win in action but they need to know how to talk. And by how to talk it mostly means with confidence.



### July 26, 2022

- Yacht party day!



### July 27, 2022

- Azure functions are very expensive. I see no reason for a team of good engineers to prefer Azure over other cloud providers. Azure is good for enterprises since they are stuck with other Microsoft tools or cannot attract/hire strong engineers.
