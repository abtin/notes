- I like to join a different type of conversation, where people don't try to prove their point. Where ego is not the main driver of the discussion, where there is nothing to prove.

- The discussion is to discover, like kids when they are trying to learn. Perhaps we lose our capacity of learning because we want to prove we are right. 

- Mind can be a camera, or a projector. How do you use your mind?

- I'm taking a look at the spacy website and try their materials.
