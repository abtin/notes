- Negative feedback is also appreciated! There is a reason for the negative feedback. It could be temporal (Not the right time) or spacial (Not the right place). At the end, life will go on and if we don't get stuck, the happiness will follow :)

#### Thoughts

- Looking for a dashboard builder for 2d simulation board. May end up using python ploty / dash. But looking for something that runs independently.

### Jan 25, 2022

#### Thoughts

- I cannot find a nice dashboard tool that can show grids / boards similar to what mesa does. Is it possible to just take the visualization part of mesa and use it?
