### Feb 06, 2022

#### Thoughts

- goolge data studio doesn't have a proper way to handle real-time data. People relies on using a chrome plug-in to keep refreshing the dashboard.

- Developers productivity metrics?! First make sure the manager is knowledgeable, but not micro-managing. Then hire smart and curious developers who communicate well and let them learn by making mistakes in a safe environment. Be nice to them and create a fun atmosphere. Then come back and talk to me about developers productivity!

- 2022-02-22: Calendars are man made concepts. We will never see some magical dates like this in our lifetime, but the same thing is true about any days.

#### Thoughts

- Thinking of writing a liveness/readiness probe for redis to use it when the cache is full. would that work as a mechanism to create back pressure on the data writers?



### Feb 24, 2022

#### Thoughts

- I need a way to visually capture the dependencies between systems, upstream and downstream. Something like https://eth.build is very useful. I need some attributes about the systems and a way to connect them to their upstream and downstream systems.
